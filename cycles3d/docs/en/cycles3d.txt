cycle. The controls are:

F1 - Show controls

Left/Right - Turns 90 degrees left and right

				  PLAYING INTERNET GAMES
==========================================================================================
1. Searching for Internet Games

Cycles3D will, by default, immediately try to connect to a game-finding server to see who is hosting
games when you open the program. To see the list, click on the GameFinder tab. You may have to wait
a few seconds for the results, first. Icons on the left will identify what kind of game you found:

No icon - Standard Internet game
Gray box - Dedicated Internet server
Three tiny boxes - LAN (local) game
Two tiny boxes and a gray box on top - Dedicated LAN (local) game

To join a game, simply double-click on the name, or use the arrow keys and space bar or enter key
to navigate.

Also notice the "Search for games on startup" and "Private hosting" option in SETUP.EXE.
These will let you choose if Cycles3D searches for games, and if you want your Internet
game to be known to the whole internet.


2. Hosting a game

	To host a game, click on the "Host game" button, or type in "/host" in the
	Internet tab. If it works, it will say "*** Now hosting internet game." The
	name of your game can be set in SETUP.EXE or the options tab under "Game Title."
	Game names may only have alphanumeric or underscore "_" characters.


3. Joining a game

	To join an Internet game, you can do one of two things:
		A. Go to the GameFinder tab and double-click on the name.

		B. Type in "/connect " followed by the IP address of the person
		hosting a game. For example: /connect 122.124.77.4.

4. Leaving a game

	Type in /disconnect, or select "Disconnect" to leave a game.

5. Getting into the game

	You may only start a game if you are hosting it. To start, just click on
	PLAY! or type in /play when everyone is in.


					DEDICATED SERVER
==========================================================================================
1. Starting up

	Cycles3D now has the ability for players to host dedicated servers. Select
	"Dedicated Server" from the Internet or LAN tabs to start it up, depending on
	what kind of dedicated server you want (Internet or local).

	In a dedicated server, the graphics are closed and a dialog appears. You have
	the ability to talk to players by typing in text in the white edit box and
	clicking on the "Say" button. They, in turn, have the ability to talk to you.
	The game-find server will also be notified your dedicated server is up.

2. Players

	To specify how many computer players and maximum players altogether you
	want to allow on your server, go in the Options tab and change the numbers
	on the bottom of the screen.

	**There will always be one extra computer player in addition to the number
	you specify to keep the server alive at all times.

3. Exiting

	When you click on the exit button, you will close down Cycles3D and remove
	all players in the game.

4. Server logging

	The dedicated server will produce and write to a log file specified by the
	setup executable. If you close the server and open it again, the file will
	be appended to, not overwritten. This file is also accessed by c3dhtml.dll.
	This DLL is used to generate a rankings HTML given a template HTML document.
	



					   PLAYING LAN GAMES

game to be known to the whole internet.


2. Hosting a game

	Same interface as Internet games...only it should say "*** Now hosting LAN game."
	You may not host an Internet and LAN game at the same time.
